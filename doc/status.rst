libNeuroML
----------
libNeuroML (http://libneuroml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is a major component of the pyramidal effort, providing the object-model backend. Currently libNeuroML has the following status.

    *Read neuroml morphology - 100%
    *Write neuroml - 50%
    *Read HDF5 - 0%
    *Write HDF5 - 100%    
    *Internal morphology representation - 100%
    *Internal kinetics (voltage clamp, ion currents etc) representation - 50%

NEURON environment
------------------

    *Inserting kinetic components (IClamp, VClamp etc..) into segments - 50%
    *Inserting ion channels into segments - 50%
    *NEURON internal representation of morphology - 100%

MOOSE environment
-----------------

    *Inserting kinetic components (IClamp, VClamp etc..) into segments - 25%
    *Inserting ion channels into segments - 0%
    *NEURON internal representation of morphology - 50%
