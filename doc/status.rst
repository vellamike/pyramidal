=============================

libNeuroML
----------
libNeuroML (http://libneuroml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is a major component of the pyramidal effort, providing the object-model backend. Currently libNeuroML has the following status.

    * Read neuroml morphology - 100%
    * Write neuroml - 50%
    * Read HDF5 - 0%
    * Write HDF5 - 100%    
    * Internal morphology representation - 100%
    * Internal kinetics (voltage clamp, ion currents etc) representation - 50%

NEURON environment
------------------

    * Inserting kinetic components (IClamp, VClamp etc..) into segments - 50%
    * Inserting ion channels into segments - 100%
    * NEURON internal representation of morphology - 100%

MOOSE environment
-----------------

    * Inserting kinetic components (IClamp, VClamp etc..) into segments - 50%
    * Inserting ion channels into segments - 100%
    * NEURON internal representation of morphology - 75%
